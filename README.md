# SepsisDetectionProject
Sepsis, commonly called ‘blood poisoning’, is really the adverse consequence of the body's response to an infection, which results in organ damage. It is recognized as a global health priority by the World Health Organization in 2017. Detecting sepsis at an earlier stage can save life and cut down financial expenses for the patient. Various studies were carried out for developing early prediction models for detecting sepsis in patients. Due to advancements in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, these fields also have great application in the medical field. Machine learning algorithms are used to predict sepsis in advance and help people in getting proper medication. Different learning algorithms can diagnose or predict sepsis and thus can prevent the progression of sepsis. This work provides a comparative analysis of different Machine Learning algorithms applied on the dataset referred from Physionet website, which was made available freely for the challenge 2019. This work provides a comparison of different parameters of algorithms which are accuracy, recall, etc.
